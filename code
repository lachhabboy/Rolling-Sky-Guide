		"description": "In Rolling Sky you’re tasked with keeping your ball safely rolling across ten neon-colored precariously-floating danger-filled musically-timed raceways, an experience that couldn’t help but to instantly remind me of Neon Drive (minus the invoked eighties aesthetic). You control this game by eternally holding a single finger on your iDevice’s screen, which you then slide back and forth to likewise control your ball to move across the track accordingly. These same controls work whether your ball is safely rolling along as solid-surface, or if your ball is currently being tossed majestically through the air. Each level is set in stone. Where the spike pit was last time you played is where it âll be this time. This means you have to spend time learning each level and this is no easy feat. Some of the levels are seriously tricky and will require multiple attempts, especially if you want to collect the diamonds that are scattered about. You can also purchase your way out of this advertising which is a nice option for fans that hate adverts and want to throw some money the developers way. These courses only last about 3 or 4 minutes each, which may not sound like much of a game, but when you consider how hard they are to finish and how much harder it is to finish AND collect all the games, you've got something that should keep you busy for some time.",

		"description": "Players control the ball by sliding a finger underneath it to guide it in the right direction. But your reflexes have to be fast to keep up as the path unfolds before you. This game is ad-supported. It also gives you a limited number of balls with which to roll down the track. You can get more balls the supply will recharge over time. You can watch ads to pick up some game supplies as well. Paying $2 will get rid of the ads and make sure your supplies never run out. With runners that have an end, after playing through the same course 5 to 6 times you’ll begin to remember the positions of different obstacles, allowing you to prepare for them before they strike, allowing you to in a sense, “see the future!”. The way you control your player a red ball in Rolling Sky is easy, with simple tap and drag controls moving your player around dropping, smashing, blasting, and spinning obstacles is easy. As long as you’ve played the stage a few times. If you’re a fan of cool graphics, the console style 3D graphics used in Rolling Sky are awesome and add a nice overall feel to the game.",

		"description": "Once started, a screen will appear by which you can access to the levels, to the game store or modify the settings. The goal is to get a ball at the end of each level, moving it to left or right with the aim to avoid obstacles. The level of difficulty is really high, because by increasing the level (that are all playable from the start, there is no need to complete the previous to move to the next level) the speed of the ball rises, such as the complexity of the level. The complexity of the levels is precisely one of the factors that make this game a real challenge. Some levels are very difficult to interpret, but, if you can do it, you will feel extremely satisfied.In the game Store, you can buy balls and other objects. Moreover, you can get more balls, for example by watching a short video advertisement.This game will keep you busy a few tens of minutes per day, for a week or two. I think that it’s good to play during the breaks, because otherwise, if played assiduously, can quickly tire out. I recommend everyone to try it. It’s free and, even if the game make you a little nervous, you will feel satisfied at the end of each level.",
